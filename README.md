## Loopback API for testing agains Front-End Application

#### How to use:

  - RUN git clone
  - RUN npm install
  - RUN npm start

  Web server listening at: http://0.0.0.0:3000
  Browse your REST API at http://0.0.0.0:3000/explorer

#### Tips:

  - Check if port is /3000

  - The port is static in our webbapp project.

##### The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

 - Really quick to use, question is how easy it is to maintain?   <Br />
 - Haven't got so far yet, give me feedback if you go all out.
